Residence Visualization
=======================

Visualize the movement of residence artists.

Make your own copy of [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HiRxrFpTwoaE1crh7OerStbKUyHu3ehLbTWGtsPxo3o/edit?usp=sharing) to input your data, then download each sheet as a CSV file and put them in your Processing sketch's data folder. (You can do this by opening `residencevisualization.pde` and dragging the files to the Processing window.)

Then you will want to add images for each artists. A square JPEG image with the artist's `artist_id` (from the spreadsheet at Google Drive) as the filename will work. The full filename should be `artist_id.jpg` (for example: `hirofumi.jpg`).

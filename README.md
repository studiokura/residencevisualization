Residence Visualization
=======================

Visualize the movement of your Artist in Residence program's artists. You need not be a programmer to input your data and see it in movement.

### Watching the Video

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM6Ew8Qu85A) you can see what Residence Visualization looks like, and how one inputs the data.

### Installing the Software

You will need to install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) and the Unfolding Maps library. Open the Library Manager from the Sketch menu → Import Library... → Add Library..., then search for __Unfolding Maps__ and install it.

You will then be able to run the software we distribute. Download [Residence Visualization](https://github.com/studiokura/residencevisualization/archive/master.zip) as a Zip archive or [clone](https://github.com/studiokura/residencevisualization.git) our repository. You may want to put the `residencevisualization` folder inside your Processing Sketchbook, but that's not needed. You just need to open the main Processing file in the project, `residencevisualization.pde`.

### Getting your data ready

Make your own copy of [this Google Sheets document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HiRxrFpTwoaE1crh7OerStbKUyHu3ehLbTWGtsPxo3o/edit?usp=sharing) to input your data, then download each sheet as a CSV file and put them in your Processing sketch's data folder. (You can do this by opening `residencevisualization.pde` and dragging the files to the Processing window.)

Then you will want to add images for each artists. A square JPEG image with the artist's `artist_id` (from the spreadsheet at Google Drive) as the filename will work. The full filename should be `artist_id.jpg` (for example: `hirofumi.jpg`).

### Still in Developmment

We are just starting to make this software available to other Artist in Residence programs, so it is not as friendly as it should be. We are still working on it, and will be very happy to her any suggestions and to help you with any problems.
